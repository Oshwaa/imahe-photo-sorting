# Photo Sorting Web App

## Overview
This project is a web application for sorting photos using Node.js and OpenCV with Python. It leverages YOLOv3 for object detection, enhancing the accuracy of the photo sorter by detecting objects in images, even those with significant blur. This ensures that images containing objects, regardless of their quality, are classified correctly, improving the overall effectiveness of the sorting.

## Work in Progress

### To Do
- **Users Management**: Implement user management with PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Google Drive Cloud Integration**: Set up integration with Google Drive for handling photo uploads.
